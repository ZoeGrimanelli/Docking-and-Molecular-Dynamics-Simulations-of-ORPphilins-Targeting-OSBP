# Docking-and-Molecular-Dynamics-Simulations-of-ORPphilins-Targeting-OSBP
Protocol for setting up, running and analyzing molecular docking and MD simulations of small molecules interacting with the ORD domain of OSBP

The simulation files and VMD script were adapted from https://github.com/jalemkul/gmx_tutorials_livecoms/tree/master/tutorial-files/lysozyme and https://github.com/purnawanpp/NAMD-MMPBGBSA/blob/main/contactFreq.tcl.
